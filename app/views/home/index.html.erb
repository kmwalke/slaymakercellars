    <h1>What is Mead?</h1>
    <p>
      Mead is "Honey Wine". We work with local apiaries to source the best honey around. We then use traditional
      winemaking techniques to ferment the honey into mead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mead may be the oldest fermented beverage known to humans. It was popular from 12,000 years ago all the way up
      to the renaissance, when beer and grape wine took over as the most popular drinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the modern day, mead has been seeing a bit of a resurgence. Slaymaker Cellars if excited to be a part of this
      new renaissance.
